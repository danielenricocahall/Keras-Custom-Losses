# Keras Custom Loss Functions #
In this repository, you'll find implementations of various custom loss functions in Keras, primarily geared towards segmentations. These loss functions include:

* Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) loss
  * Log DSC loss (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00044/full)
  * Cos Dice Loss (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04459)
* Weighted Hausdorff Loss Function (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07564)
