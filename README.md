# Weighted Hausdorff Distance Loss #
In this repository, you'll find an implementation of the weighted Hausdorff Distance Loss, described here (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07564). A majority of the work was just porting their PyTorch implementation (https://github.com/HaipengXiong/weighted-hausdorff-loss), but it should function identically.

## TODO ## 
Add an example script.
